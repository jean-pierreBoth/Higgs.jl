# Basic images of Higgs data 

See [Higgs-data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS) 

We give:

- Some 2 dimensional slices in the data, exploring most apparent features
  
- Basic Julia functions to explore the data: centering/rescaling, PCA and images generation with sparse random 2 dimensional projection.

- A Jupyter notebook with results. After runnning the whole notebook,  re-running the last cell 
  give image of various random 2 dimensional projection of the data.

This was done as tentative assessment of the various emdedding
